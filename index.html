            <p>  A very long time from now, in what used to be the city of Seattle, there lived a magical squirrel that could grant wishes. 
               The squirrel had captured a shooting star and made a deal with it. "I so wish not to disappear forever could you please eat me and that way we can both live forever!" said the shooting star.
                "I've never caught a shooting star before! Will you make me a wizard?" Asked the squirrel. The shooting star only had a few more moments and not wanting to fade away forever replied, "Yes! I will make you a wizard just eat me quickly!" 
                 </p>

            <p>The squirrel put the shooting star to its mouth, took a big gulp, and ate the star in one bite. 
               "He kind of tasted like popcorn." Thought the squirrel.</p>

            <p>Then, a flash of light surrounded the squirrel. The light was so bright the other animals thought morning was coming. 
               The birds began to sing, the cows woke up, and even the moon became scarred  because he thought the sun was finally going to catch him. 
              When the light went away, the squirrel stood where he caught the shooting star but now he had a fun hat and a new wand that matched.</p>

            <p>This is how squirrel was able to grant wishes. Although the squirrel didn't grant a lot of wishes. 
                  If one of the other animals wanted the magic squirrel to grant them a wish, the animal had to give squirrel their favorite thing in the whole world. 
                  The first wish the squirrel granted was to a fox who wished to be turned into a bear. "Why would you want to become a bear?" Asked the squirrel. 
                  "Because I met the most beautiful grizzly bear yesterday and she said she wouldn't marry a fox."  </p>

            <p>"What would I have to do for you to marry me?" Asked the fox. 
                     "Unless you can find a way to become a great big bear I'll never marry you."</p>

            <p>"I can make you a bear! Did you bring your favorite thing in the whole world for me to grant your wish?" Asked the squirrel. 
               "Yes, I brought my lucky boots. I have these on and good things happen to me! They are magic just like you!" 
               The squirrel took the boots and tapped them his wand.  </p>
               <img src="images/fox give boots.png" alt="A Wizard Squirrel" width="800" height="400" class="center">
          <p>The boots disappeared and then he pointed his wand at the fox. 
                  The fox turned into the biggest and strongest bear the woods had ever seen!</p>

            <p>When the fox, I mean the great big bear, went to see the bear he wanted to marry, she yelled, "Wow you are the biggest, strongest bear I have ever seen!" 
               "It's me the fox! I became a bear just like you said! Will you marry me now that I am a great big bear?" 
               "The fox you say? You must have had the squirrel grant you a wish! I'm sorry but I still can't marry you!" 
               "Why not?! I became a bear like you wanted!" "I only want to marry a funny bear and I don't think you're very funny." 
               "What if I told you a joke?" "It better be a good joke!" Said the bear. "Knock knock!" "Who's there?" 
               "Some bear..." "Some bear who?" "Some bear, sometime!" "That wasn't a funny joke, fox" 
               "I'm a bear! What will I do now that I'm a bear and don't have my favorite boots?!" </p>

               <p>The fox who was a bear, ran back to the magic squirrel who ate a shooting star, 
                  and begged him to turn him back into a fox. "I can only grant you one wish! 
                  An animal only has one favorite thing or else it wouldn't be his favorite!" </p>

               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The squirrel granted anyone who wanted a wish one but he warned all the animals to make sure 
                  they were funny before he would turn them into bears. </p>
